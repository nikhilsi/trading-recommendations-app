    - API documentation
    - Webhook support

17. **Mobile App** ⭐️⭐️
    - React Native or PWA
    - Push notifications
    - Simplified interface

## 📋 Implementation Considerations

### Database Schema Changes Required:
- Add `user_id` to all tables
- Create `users`, `invites`, `user_sessions` tables
- Update all queries to filter by user
- Implement audit logging

### Security Considerations:
- HTTPS everywhere
- Rate limiting per user
- API key rotation
- Session timeout policies
- Data encryption at rest

### Infrastructure Changes:
- Redis for session management
- Email service (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- Consider multi-tenant architecture
- Backup strategy per user

## 🎯 Critical Path Dependencies

```
User Auth → Data Isolation → All Other Features
     ↓
Invite System → User Registration
     ↓
User Dashboard → Presets/Settings/Analytics
```

## 📊 Effort vs Impact Matrix

| Phase | Business Impact | Technical Complexity | User Value | Priority |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| User System | Critical | High | Enabling | **MUST DO FIRST** |
| Quick Wins | High | Low | High | **IMMEDIATE AFTER** |
| Real-time | Medium | Medium | High | **NICE TO HAVE** |
| Advanced | High | High | Medium | **DIFFERENTIATOR** |
| Premium | High | Medium | Low | **MONETIZATION** |

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Decision Points

1. **After Phase 1:** Is the auth system secure and scalable?
2. **After Phase 2:** Are users engaging with saved presets?
3. **After Phase 3:** Is real-time adding enough value?
4. **After Phase 4:** Ready for paid tiers?

## 💭 Strategic Questions to Answer

1. **Invite Strategy:** How exclusive? Waitlist? Referral rewards?
2. **Data Retention:** How long to keep user data? GDPR compliance?
3. **Pricing Model:** Freemium? Trial period? Feature-based tiers?
4. **Scale Planning:** Expected user count? Database partitioning strategy?
